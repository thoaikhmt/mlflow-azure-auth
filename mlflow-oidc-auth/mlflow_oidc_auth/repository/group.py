"""Groups and group membership.

**Membership ownership (#360).** Every ``user_groups`` row records which source granted it in
``managed_by``: ``manual`` (unattributed, or an administrator), ``scim`` (the directory, #323), or
``oidc:<provider>`` / ``saml:<provider>`` (a login's claims). Group membership is the privilege
carrier, so the ``managed_by`` guard (:mod:`mlflow_oidc_auth.ownership`) covers it row by row:

* **Adding** a membership is never a cross-source write. It creates a row the writer owns. A row
  that already exists keeps its owner — nothing here re-owns a membership.
* **Removing** one depends on who owns the row and on the kind of write. ``manual`` rows are
  removable by any source (they are what every membership written before #360 is, so an
  authoritative login keeps revoking them exactly as it did), and a source's own rows by it.
* A **sync** (:meth:`GroupRepository.set_groups_for_user`, a SCIM ``PUT``) states the whole
  membership the writer wants, and **never removes another source's row, in any mode**; it is
  recorded as a conflict under ``report`` and ``enforce``. Refusing the whole sync would stop a
  directory or an IdP from ever updating that user or group again, and removing the row would
  undo the other source's decision at every sign-in.
* A **targeted** removal (SCIM ``PATCH`` ``remove``) of another source's row goes through
  :func:`~mlflow_oidc_auth.ownership.evaluate_write`: removed and recorded under ``report``,
  refused atomically under ``enforce``, removed silently under ``off``.

**Group ownership.** Groups carry ``managed_by`` too. Every group-centric write here (SCIM
``/Groups``) checks the group's owner with
:func:`~mlflow_oidc_auth.ownership.evaluate_group_write` before anything else: only the owning
source writes a group under ``enforce``.

        Every membership row is evaluated with :func:`~mlflow_oidc_auth.ownership.evaluate_group_delete`:
        a membership ``written_by`` does not own — ``manual`` included, service accounts included —
        is a conflict. Under ``enforce`` any conflict refuses the delete and nothing is written;
        under ``report`` the delete proceeds and each conflict is recorded.

        Returns:
            ``(memberships, grants)``: the ``(username, group_name)`` memberships removed, and the
            number of grant rows deleted per permission table — for the audit record, since the
            grants cannot be rebuilt from anything else.

        Raises:
            MlflowException: ``RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`` for an unknown group;
                :class:`MembershipRefused` when the guard refuses it.
