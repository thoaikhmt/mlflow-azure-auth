"""In-flight authorization state, server-side (issue #316).

A login is a round trip: the browser leaves for the provider and comes back with ``code`` and
``state``, and the server has to remember what it started. That memory used to be a single
``oauth_state`` key in the cookie, which two problems follow from:

* **Two tabs clobber each other.** One key holds one attempt, so starting a second login
  overwrites the first, and whichever comes back second fails a CSRF check it should have passed.
* **Nothing records which provider started it.** With one provider that is answerable by
  assumption. With several it is the [RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207.html)
  mix-up question — an authorization response says nothing about who sent it, and ``code`` and
  ``state`` look identical whichever authorization server produced them.

A row per attempt answers both. The row names the issuer the transaction began with, which is
what ``validate_response_issuer`` (#307) compares the returned ``iss`` against.

**Single use.** ``consume`` claims the row with the delete itself and reports the attempt only to
the caller whose delete matched, so two callbacks racing one state cannot both proceed and a replay
finds nothing.
