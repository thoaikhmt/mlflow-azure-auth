"""
Workspace Context Middleware for FastAPI.

This middleware sets the MLflow workspace context (via ContextVar) for each request,
ensuring that all downstream tracking-store operations (search_experiments,
list_gateway_endpoints, etc.) execute within the correct workspace scope.

Without this middleware, MLflow 3.10's workspace-aware tracking store raises
"Active workspace is required" errors on any store operation when workspaces
are enabled.

The implementation mirrors MLflow's own ``workspace_context_middleware`` in
``mlflow.server.fastapi_app``, adapted for the OIDC auth plugin's middleware
stack.

    Sets the MLflow workspace ContextVar for the lifetime of each request.

    When ``MLFLOW_ENABLE_WORKSPACES`` is enabled this middleware:
    1. Reads the ``X-MLFLOW-WORKSPACE`` header from the request.
    2. Resolves the active workspace via MLflow's ``resolve_workspace_for_request_if_enabled``,
       on the routed path (see :func:`~mlflow_oidc_auth.middleware.route_path.routed_path`) — the
       same path the router dispatches and authorization decides on, with any ``root_path``
       recorded by the ASGI server or a trusted proxy removed.
    3. Calls ``set_server_request_workspace()`` so that all downstream
       ``_get_tracking_store()`` calls operate in the correct workspace.
    4. Clears the ContextVar in a ``finally`` block after the response is sent.

    When workspaces are disabled this middleware is a transparent pass-through.
