    MLflow registers every one of its own REST handlers under both "/api/..."
    and "/ajax-api/...", and its web UI calls the "/ajax-api" variants. This
    plugin's routers were registered under "/api" only, so UI calls such as
    ``GET /ajax-api/2.0/mlflow/users/current`` matched no FastAPI route, fell
    through to the mounted Flask app and returned 404. The UI reads that failure
    as "not authenticated" (its current-user query runs with ``retry: false``,
    after which ``is_admin`` is false and ``username`` empty), so it hides the
    edit affordances even for admins.

    Routes outside the REST prefix - health checks and the "/oidc/*" routes -
    have no UI-facing twin and are left alone.

        router: The router whose API routes should be mirrored.

        exposes no routes under the REST prefix.
