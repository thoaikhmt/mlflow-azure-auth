def _resolve_run_artifact_repository(artifact_uri: str):
    """
    Resolve the artifact repository backing a run's artifact root, translating a proxied
    ``mlflow-artifacts:`` URI to this server's configured artifact destination.

    A run's ``artifact_uri`` uses the ``mlflow-artifacts`` scheme when the tracking server
    serves artifacts itself (``mlflow server --serve-artifacts``): the real storage location
    (e.g. ``s3://bucket/...``) is rewritten to ``mlflow-artifacts:/<path>`` and resolved back
    to the real location at request time using the server's ``--artifacts-destination`` root.
    ``get_artifact_repository`` alone cannot do this translation here: it falls back to
    resolving ``mlflow-artifacts:`` relative to the process-global tracking URI, which inside
    this server process is the backend-store URI (a database), not an HTTP(S) endpoint, so it
    raises. Resolve it the same way ``mlflow.server.handlers`` does when it serves or deletes
    proxied artifacts instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    artifact_uri : str
        The run's artifact root URI, as returned by the backend store.

    Returns
    -------
    ArtifactRepository
        The repository backing the run's real artifact storage location.

    Raises
    ------
    MlflowException
        If ``artifact_uri`` uses the ``mlflow-artifacts`` scheme but this server has no
        ``--artifacts-destination`` configured, so the real storage location is unknown, or if
        it has no path component of its own, so it cannot be mapped to anything narrower than
