"""Resources a departing user leaves without a manager (issues #324, #375).

When a directory deactivates or deletes someone, anything *only they* could manage becomes
unmanageable by anyone short of an administrator. That is not a reason to block the
deprovisioning — access removal must never wait on housekeeping — but it is something an
operator needs to hear about. This module finds those resources and reports them as
``resource.orphaned`` audit events, and, when ``ORPHAN_FALLBACK_PRINCIPAL`` is configured, hands
them to that principal as part of the hard delete that cascades the departing user's grants away.

Not to be confused with :mod:`mlflow_oidc_auth.ownership`, which is the ``managed_by`` write guard
on user rows.

**Which resources are the departing user's.** Those they hold ``MANAGE`` on *directly*, or
through a *group* holding ``MANAGE`` on it (``via`` is ``"direct"`` or ``"group:<name>"`` on the
event). A user whose only path to a resource was a regex grant is not enumerated: a pattern
matches resources in the tracking store, including ones not created yet, and walking the store on
every deprovisioning is out of proportion to a report.

**What counts as another holder.** Another *active* user whose permission on the resource resolves
to ``MANAGE``, replaying ``PERMISSION_SOURCE_ORDER`` over their direct grant, their groups' grants
(the most permissive group wins), their own patterns and their groups' patterns — the first source
with an answer decides, as at request time. So a colleague with a direct ``READ`` grant is not a
holder under the default order even if a group of theirs holds ``MANAGE``, and a group in which the
departing user was the last active member keeps nothing managed.

Patterns are matched exactly as the request-time resolvers match them (priority order, first match;
for workspaces the most permissive of the best-priority matches), against the same subject: the
experiment's *name*, the model or prompt name, the scorer name, the gateway key, the workspace name.
Where the subject lives in MLflow (an experiment's name, whether a registered model is a prompt) it
is looked up in every workspace when workspaces are enabled, with at most
:data:`_EXTERNAL_LOOKUP_LIMIT` store calls per resource type. A resource whose answer depends on a
lookup that fails is reported with ``via: "unresolved"`` and a warning, and is **never** handed over.

Admins are not counted as holders — an admin can always recover a resource, which is precisely why
an orphan is a report and never a refusal.

    have been flushed (the fallback's grants are independent of the rows removed). So a delete

    delete has committed.

    The ``managed_by`` guard (#360) is evaluated by the delete itself, before either hook runs:
