"""Resolve an external identity to a local user (issue #309).

``users.username`` is the only identity key today, so with more than one provider configured two
IdPs asserting the same email would silently share an account. This module decides, for a given
``(provider_id, subject, claims)``, whether an existing user is reached, a new one should be
created, or the attempt is refused.

Interactive login (``routers/auth.py``, SAML included) applies it and binds the identity; bearer
authentication applies it read-only when the registry holds more than one provider of any type
(``middleware/auth_middleware._bearer_identity``).

The rule that matters:

``identity_binding: subject``
    Only ``(provider_id, sub)`` reaches a user. A claim asserting somebody else's email cannot
    link to their account, because email is never consulted.

``identity_binding: email``
    May link to an existing user by email, but only when the email's domain is in the provider's
    ``allowed_email_domains``. A provider is trusted to speak for the domains an operator listed
    and no others — otherwise any IdP able to assert ``admin@yourcompany.com`` would take over
    that account.

Both modes refuse to move an identity that is already bound to a different user. Once
``(provider_id, subject)`` names a user, only that user answers to it.
