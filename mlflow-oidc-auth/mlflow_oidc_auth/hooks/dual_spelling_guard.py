"""Reject ambiguous requests before any authorization decision (issue #270).

MLflow parses request bodies as proto-JSON.  ``protobuf.ParseDict`` accepts a
field under BOTH its snake_case name AND its lowerCamelCase ``json_name``, and
when both keys appear it silently resolves to the LAST one in JSON order, which
is caller-controlled.  Any authorization check that reads a single spelling of a
field can therefore be bypassed::

    {"experiment_id": "attacker_own", "experimentId": "victim"}

makes the validator authorize ``attacker_own`` (which the caller owns) while
MLflow operates on ``victim``.  The impact spans cross-tenant READ as well as
WRITE/DELETE on every gated mutating route.

No legitimate MLflow client emits a field under two spellings: the Python client
serializes with ``preserving_proto_field_name=True`` (snake_case) and the browser
UI sends snake_case request bodies.  Rejecting a dual-spelling request with 400
therefore cannot break a real client — it only closes the ambiguity an attacker
relies on.

GET requests need care.  MLflow's ``_get_request_message`` builds the proto from
``request.args`` (keyed by snake_case ``field.name``, so camelCase query params
are never read) **only when the query string is non-empty**::

    if flask_request.method == "GET" and flask_request.args:   # args path
        ...
    else:                                                       # body path
        request_json = _get_normalized_request_json(flask_request)
    parse_dict(request_json, request_message)

A GET with an *empty* query string therefore falls through and proto-parses the
JSON **body**, with full dual-spelling semantics.  Worse, validators that read
only ``request.args`` find nothing in such a request and authorize *vacuously*
(no store lookup at all) while MLflow serves whatever the body named.  So a GET
that carries a body MLflow will parse is rejected outright — see
``has_unexpected_get_body``.  No legitimate client sends a GET body; real clients
put GET parameters in the query string, which stays on the safe args path.

The ``(path, method) -> proto class`` map is derived from MLflow's own service
registry via ``get_endpoints``, so it covers every proto endpoint MLflow serves —
current and future — with no manual maintenance.  A few proto-parsing handlers are
registered with ``@app.route`` instead and never appear in that registry, so they
are bound by enumerating the real Flask routing table (see
``_NON_REGISTRY_PROTO_ROUTES``).  The request body is read through MLflow's own
``_get_normalized_request_json`` so the guard inspects exactly the dict MLflow will
``parse_dict`` (force-parsed, double-encoding aware), leaving no room for a
``Content-Type`` evasion.
