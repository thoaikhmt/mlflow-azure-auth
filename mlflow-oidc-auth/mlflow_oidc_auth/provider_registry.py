"""Identity provider registry (issue #308).

Configuration is a flat set of ``OIDC_*`` singletons and cannot express more than one identity
provider. This module adds a structured registry that can, while leaving the flat variables as
the sole source of truth for deployments that have not adopted it.

**Nothing consumes this yet.** It is the shape the rest of the enterprise-identity epic (#304)
is built against; login, callback and token validation are unchanged by this module.

Two ways to configure it, both read through the existing ``config_providers`` chain so secrets
managers keep working:

``AUTH_PROVIDERS``
    A JSON array of provider objects.
``AUTH_PROVIDERS_FILE``
    A path to a file containing the same JSON.

With neither set, a single provider ``default`` is synthesised from the flat ``OIDC_*``
variables with ``jit`` / ``every_login`` / ``authoritative`` — which is what the plugin does
today, so an existing deployment sees no change.

Invalid entries are **dropped, not repaired**, and the reasons are reported so startup can log
them. Dropping rather than raising follows the ``_warn_if_*`` precedent in ``config.py``:
``AppConfig`` is a module-level singleton imported by tooling with nothing to do with login —
Alembic's migration environment, for one — so raising here would take that tooling down over a
provider it never uses. Dropping is also the deny-by-default answer: an entry that cannot be
validated does not exist, so nobody can authenticate through it.

class ProviderConfig:
    """One identity provider and the policy that applies to it.

    Frozen because the registry is read at startup and shared; a consumer mutating a provider
    in place would change authentication policy for every later request.

    Attributes:
        id: Stable identifier, unique across the registry. Used as ``provider_id`` on
            ``user_identities`` rows (#333).
        type: One of ``oidc``, ``saml``, ``k8s``.
        display_name: Human-readable label for the login picker.
        provisioning: ``jit`` creates users on first login, ``scim`` expects an external
            directory to create them, ``none`` requires them to exist already.
        group_sync: When group membership is refreshed from provider claims.
        group_sync_mode: ``authoritative`` replaces local membership with the claim,
            ``additive`` only adds.
        admin_source: Where administrator status may come from. Never ``scim``.
        interactive: Whether this provider can carry a browser login flow, and so whether it
            belongs on the login page (#317, #330). Independent of ``type``, which describes how
            a credential is *verified*: a ``k8s`` provider verifies tokens exactly as an
            ``oidc`` one does, but a projected service-account token is presented directly as a
            bearer credential — there is no authorization endpoint to redirect to. Defaults
            from the type and cannot be set True for a type that has no browser flow.
        identity_binding: Which token field identifies the user.
        allowed_email_domains: Required when binding on ``email``; an email-bound provider
            with no domain restriction lets anyone who can prove any address take an account.
        allowed_algorithms: Accepted JWT signing algorithms.
        audience: Expected ``aud``. Required — a token with no audience check is valid for
            any relying party the issuer serves.
        issuer: Expected ``iss``, when known.
        discovery_url: OIDC discovery document, for ``oidc`` providers.
        client_id: OAuth client id, for ``oidc`` providers.
        public_client: ``oidc`` only. The client was issued without a client secret, so PKCE
            authenticates its token exchange instead (#300). Opt-in: a missing secret on a
            provider that does not declare this is a configuration error, not a public client.
            False by default; for the synthesised ``default`` provider it comes from
            ``OIDC_PUBLIC_CLIENT``.
        userinfo_groups: ``oidc`` only. Whether the groups and workspace claims may be read from
            the provider's UserInfo endpoint when the ID token lacks them. They decide access,
            administrator status and workspace membership, so this is opt-in: by default only
            identity claims (username, email, display name) are completed from UserInfo. False by
            default; for the synthesised ``default`` provider it comes from ``OIDC_USERINFO_GROUPS``.
        bearer_adopts_unbound_accounts: ``oidc`` only, and not ``default``. Whether this provider's
            bearer tokens may reach an existing non-admin account that no identity is bound to —
            one this provider's bearer provisioning created before identities were bound, or one
            an administrator created — and bind it to the token's ``(provider, sub)`` on first use,
            after which only that identity reaches it. Off by default: such an account could also
            be a human's who has not signed in since identities were recorded.
        jwks_inline: Key set written into configuration, for a cluster whose JWKS cannot be
            fetched. The only mode that needs no network at all.
        jwks_uri: Key set URL, when it is known and discovery is not readable.
        ca_bundle_path: CA bundle for fetching from the cluster's API server.
        in_cluster: Fetch keys from the API server using the pod's own service-account token.
        namespace_allowlist: Namespaces whose service accounts may be provisioned. Empty means
            none — a service-account token carries no group claim, so nothing else narrows who
            may become a user.
        allow_tokens_without_expiry: Accept a bearer token that carries no ``exp`` claim (#356).
            False by default, so every such token is refused — otherwise it would be valid
            forever. Exists for legacy (non-bound) Kubernetes service-account tokens, which have
            no ``exp``; accepted only on a token provider type and logged at load when set.
        entity_id: SAML only. This service's SP entity id, the audience every assertion must
            name.
        idp_entity_id: SAML only. The IdP's entity id; every ``Issuer`` must equal it.
        idp_sso_url: SAML only. The IdP's HTTP-Redirect SingleSignOnService.
        idp_slo_url: SAML only. The IdP's HTTP-Redirect SingleLogoutService, when it has one.
        idp_x509_certs: SAML only. Certificates an IdP signature may verify against (more than
            one during a rotation), as base64 DER.
        idp_metadata_url: SAML only. Where the IdP's metadata was read from, when it was.
        sp_x509_cert: SAML only. This service's signing certificate, published in its metadata.
        sp_private_key: SAML only. The key for ``sp_x509_cert``. Never in a repr or a log line.
        name_id_format: SAML only. The ``NameIDPolicy`` format requested.
        attribute_username: SAML only. Attribute naming the local account.
        attribute_groups: SAML only. Attribute carrying group names.
        attribute_display_name: SAML only. Attribute carrying the display name.
        want_assertions_signed: SAML only. Require the assertion itself to be signed.
        want_response_signed: SAML only. Require the enclosing Response to be signed.
        clock_skew_seconds: SAML only. Allowance applied to assertion validity windows.
        sign_requests: SAML only. Sign AuthnRequests, LogoutRequests and LogoutResponses.
