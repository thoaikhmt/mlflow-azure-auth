# Dual-spelling extraction (security-critical)
#
# MLflow bodies are proto-JSON. protobuf's ParseDict accepts a field under BOTH its
# snake_case name and its lowerCamelCase json name, and when BOTH appear it resolves to
# the LAST one in JSON key order — which the caller controls. So a validator that reads
# only one spelling can be handed {"experiment_id":"mine","experimentId":"victim"}: it
# authorizes "mine" while MLflow operates on "victim" (cross-tenant read/delete/link).
#
# Defence: collect EVERY spelling's value and require the permission on ALL of them. A
# legitimate client sends a single spelling, so this never over-denies real traffic; a
# request carrying both is authorized against the victim value too and therefore denied.

    The destination is ``trace.trace_info.trace_location.mlflow_experiment.experiment_id``.
    A body naming no experiment (or a non-experiment location) is denied — there is nothing
    to authorize against.

    The body also carries a caller-chosen ``trace_id``. MLflow's SQL store does not reject
    an id that already exists: it catches the IntegrityError and merges the body into the
    EXISTING trace. So when the named trace exists:

    * UPDATE is required on its current experiment (tags / metadata are written into it);
    * DELETE is also required there when the destination differs, because the merge
      re-homes the trace into the destination — it vanishes from its experiment, which is
      a delete that ``DeleteTraces`` would gate on DELETE;
    * assessments carrying an ``assessment_id`` are refused, because the merge upserts by
      ``assessment_id`` alone and the owner of an arbitrary assessment id cannot be
      resolved here — naming another tenant's assessment would overwrite or move it.

    An assessment that names a different ``trace_id`` than the trace being started is
    refused outright: no legitimate client sends one, and the store trusts it. Only a
    definite "does not exist" counts as a new trace; any other lookup failure denies.

    Parameters:
        username: The authenticated user.

    Returns:
        True when every check above passes.
